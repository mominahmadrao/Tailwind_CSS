# Tailwand_CSS

A beginner-friendly learning repository for practicing **Tailwind CSS**.  
This repo contains small examples, components, and experiments made while learning how Utility-First CSS works.

## 🚀 About This Repo
The goal of this project is to understand:
- How Tailwind classes work
- How to style layouts without writing custom CSS
- How utility classes replace traditional CSS
- Building small components (cards, buttons, navbar, grids, etc.)

This is a practice-focused repository — not a full website.  
Each file or folder represents a small concept or Tailwind experiment.
